# Automated_Email_System_using_phpmailer
This project is a simple and efficient email scheduler built using PHP and PHPMailer. The application allows users to send emails by filling out a contact form, which includes fields for the sender's name, recipient's email address, subject, and message. Upon form submission, the email is sent to the specified recipient using the PHPMailer library.
